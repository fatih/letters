This program shows letters and numbers on the screen, full screen, and
speaks them out loud in an old Speak 'n Spell voice.  It's for little
kids.

READ THIS: quit the program by hitting ^C (that's control + C).  The idea
here is to make a sandbox that kids probably won't get out of by mistake.

Required libraries:
* OpenAL
* alut
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf
